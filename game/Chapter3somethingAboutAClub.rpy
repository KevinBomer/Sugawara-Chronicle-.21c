                Yukiko speaking questioning "Mm? Like a roadie?"

                Akari "I think Miyu pitched it to the Student Council President before, but it got vetoed. Miyu told me Kaori wanted to see a talent before giving a vague idea the O.K."
                Hiroya "That's a shame. It'd be a good way to draw attention to the school. And maybe more students would enroll..."

    Yukiko frown p2 "Ehhh, physical exercise isn't my jam. Plus I hear the baseball team's a dumpster fire, so I don't wanna get anywhere near that."
    Hiroya "Oof, don't say that around Suzuki, he'd throw a fit."
    Yukiko "Who? No, that's not important right now."
    Yukiko smile happy "The real challenge is to pick one out. Hmmm..."
    Yukiko "Aw nuts, so many options! I can't pick just one."
    Hiroya "If you're so conflicted, why don't you just pick one at random?"
    Hiroya "And if you don't like it, well, you can drop it and try another. Seems pretty simple to me!"
    Akari vhappy "Yeah! Except Cooking Club. When you come to Cooking Club, you're a member for life!"
    Yukiko speaking surprised "Huh. Not actually a bad idea."

    Akari nervous p2 "H-hey! I'm a good learner! I just buckle under pressure."
    "Clearly uncomfortable with the subject, Akari quickly changes topics."
    Akari questioning "Hey, Hiroya, did you bring anything to eat?"
    Hiroya "...No, I, uh, had a big breakfast. Think that's holding me over for now."
    Akari "Well, you should be snacking regularly through the day."
    Hiroya "I mean, I already tried it. I was at your house for dinner last night."
    Hiroya "Besides, it's your lunch, I shouldn't be mooching off you."
    Yukiko smile vhappy p2 "Well! If you're hungry, you can have a few bites of {i}myyy{/i} rice. Just to get you by!"

    Hiroya "You sure?"
    Yukiko "It's cool! You can pay me back later!"
    Hiroya "Alright. Thanks."
    "My cheeks flushed slightly as Yukiko beamed at me with her smile."

    Akari speaking p1 "Ah, better eat quick, lunch is almost over!"
    Hiroya "Crap, you're right!"
    "I shovel a few more forkfuls into my mouth, the deluge of savory flavours mixing together to massage my palate. It was really quite good, and held up well even as leftovers."
    "Pity I couldn't enjoy it for longer."
    Hiroya "Great. So we're all meeting at the usual place?"
    Akari questioning p2 "I got Cooking Club today! Yukiko, you {i}suuure{/i} you don't wanna check it out?"
    Yukiko speaking questioning p1 "Well, I already said I was going to give all the clubs a fair shake, so..."
    Yukiko smile vhappy "Alright. I'll give it a shot. Where's it usually held?"
    Akari vhappy "Room 220! I'll send you a text after class, okay?"
    Yukiko "Groovy. What'll you be up to Hiroya?"
    Hiroya "Usually I just hang out in the courtyard. Sometimes the student council lets Miyu free early and we hang out then."
    Yukiko confident "Ah, yes. Still using you as a training dummy for her fortune-telling stuff?"
    Hiroya "She's getting better at it!"
    Yukiko vhappy "Enjoy it while you can! Before long she'll be demanding ten thousand yen a session!"
    Akari p1 "Eh!? Really?"
    Yukiko "It's what I always tell her! You gotta ask what you think your services are worth!"
    Hiroya "I thiiink you're looking into it a bit too much. It's just a hobby."
    Yukiko "An under-monetized hobby. It's okay, she'll warm up to it!"

    "Students begin to trickle back into the classrooms for afternoon lectures. Next is math class."
    "Akari fumbles through her knapsack. I assume she's trying to find her textbook."
    "The same one that keeps vanishing periodically. And fairly predictably, every other week."
    "With a defeated sigh, I loan her my own. She accepts it graciously."
    "Watching her squirm is incredibly distracting, so I can survive an hour without my textbook. My grades are good enough that Hojo-sensei doesn't particularly object."
    "Glancing around the room, bored and ready for class to start, I see one of my male classmates pace over to a classmate's desk. The girl had beckoned him over."
    "My mouth flattens again. This has been a recurring soap opera that much of the class room has quietly been keeping up with."
    "The recurring saga of Touma and Aoi, two childhood best friends. Their relationship has been a hushed topic of gossip within the rest of the class."
    "Usually I opted to mind my own business, but when there was nothing else on, I listened in on the gossip and drama that filled the air."

    Touma "Huh? What's up, do you need a study partner?"
    Aoi "Nah, I think I'm getting the material a bit better! It's way better when you teach me! Hojo-sensei gets a little frustrated with all my questions, y'know?"
    Touma "Heheh, no kidding."
    "It's been a source of speculation as to what their study groups actually entail. Touma-kun has a waiting list of people asking to join."
    "Though at least a few of those on the list just want to be a fly on the wall for whatever happens between those two. Sheesh."
    Aoi "The annual harvest festival's next week, did you hear?"
    Touma "Oh, really? I guess it just slipped my mind."
    Aoi "There's gonna be rides, and food booths, and a haunted house! They're going all out this year!"
    Touma "A haunted house? Those are so tacky though."
    Aoi "Eh, a little. But they're gonna be holding a curry contest too!"
    Aoi "I heard that they're bringing back the Esophagus Exploder! It was so spicy it sent a man to the hospital, like, five years ago!"
    Touma "That's actually pretty metal. Too bad I'm no good with spicy food."
    Aoi "Heheh! Anyway, you free next week? We should {i}totally{/i} go!"
    Touma "Hmm? I think I'm free. Who else is coming?"
    Aoi "Why would I invite anyone else to our date?"
    Touma "Right, that makes sense - wait, a what now?"
    "Touma took a step back, turning red."
    Aoi "Haha! You're cute when you get all flustered like that!"
    "Aoi rested her head in her hand and crossed her legs, smirking as she did and utterly oblivious to the multitude of eyes staring at them."
    Aoi "But no, I'm super serious, we should head over, it'll be fun!"
    Aoi "Please come? After Debate Club on Wednesday, I'm super free to hang out!"
    Touma "J-Just the two of us?"
    Aoi "Mm? Did you have other plans, Touma-kun?"
    Touma "N-no, it's just... you, and me, and we, and..."
    Touma "I-it... it might be fun?"
    Aoi "Ohhh, you're exciiiited! Okay, it's settled, then! I'm gonna look into it a bit more, okay?"
    Touma "A-ah... uh... o-okay!"
    "Touma sputtered a response as Aoi hurried back to her desk, excitedly swiping at her phone. I assume she's still doing research on the festival."

    Yukiko "I think I'll start my own club! Whaddya think?"
    Hiroya "Your own club? Isn't there like, a whole approval process?"
    Yukiko speaking questioning "Yeah, about that. I was reading over my student handbook. Right here, see?"
    "As if ready for this conversation, she held her book aloft, presenting it before me."
    Yukiko "I did some reading up on the whole approval process. Turns out you need to talk to Student Council about it, buuut..."
    Yukiko "They're {i}super{/i} laissez-faire about this stuff. So long as it has 'significant student interest', you got carte blanche to do whatever~"
    Hiroya "Well, you still need, like, approval, right? The president's a tough one to crack."
    Yukiko "Yeaaah, that's the sucky part. You also need a teacher supervisor, so I gotta rub someone's back there."
    Yukiko "But I think I could get away with something! It's all about persuasion."
    "Damn. Yukiko could be quite conniving when she wants to be."

    Akari nervous "Is it that bad?"
    Hiroya "Huh? N-no, I just have something to do, that's all."

    Yukiko vhappy "Hey, the big guy has places to be. We'll see him tomorrow, alright?"
    Yukiko "And by then we'll have this thing aaaaall filled out! It'll be a hella cool surprise!"

    "Before too long, I made it to the bridge. I hid most of my stuff in the bushes apart from the concrete."
    "To my great relief, they were still there. Lucky, too. I often hear of shady folk passing through here, and they'd be easy pickings for someone desperate."
    "...This is far from an ideal living situation, but without income I'm stuck with it."

    "I don't know how much longer I can keep up this charade. Someone's eventually going to notice me sleeping under the bridge."
    "And if they don't catch that, well... I might get caught showering at school. Need to figure out something for that."
    "They have bathhouses, but those are mostly for old people and families. If they saw some kid in a Sugawara uniform mulling about, it'd raise questions."
    "That doesn't account for issues like getting food. I really don't want to start picking out of the trash; I don't care how good that steak is."
    "I could try farming along the bridge, but that'd probably raise more suspicion. Scratch that."
    "I just don't want the girls to find out. If they found out, they'd call me ridiculous for what I did. For running out on my old man."
    "Well, I'm basically an adult now. I can handle this. I've handled it well enough so far. Just need to figure out a plan."
    "A realistic plan. One without scavenging for leftovers and garbage."
    "I can risk the bathhouses though. Bathhouses are honestly pretty alright."
    "I make my paces around the block, stopping here and there to get a feel for my surroundings. Making a mental list of the resources available to me."

    "Following the familiar bends, I make it back to my bridge."

    "I stop in my tracks. There's two guys across the road lurking near my spot, dressed in all black. Are they police?"
    "...No. No, I recognize those uniforms."''
    "I can't make out much. Theres two of them. One is sort of tall. The other, sort of round."
    "The round one" "Hey. He's talking to you!"
    "The two guys start walking over. Slowly, but with menace."
    "As they step into the light I can see them more clearly. It's just as I thought."

    "The tall one" "They brand 'em, and make an example of them for everyone else."
