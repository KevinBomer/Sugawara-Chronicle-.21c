    "Some of them head straight for the school gates, others are on their way to their various club rooms."
    "Today is a Monday, so I’d usually wait around to walk home with Akari and Miyu."
    "We'd usually end up at one of their houses, where we'd screw around a bit until dinnertime."
    "Hmm, I guess it would be awkward going to my place now, seeing as my only \"home\" is that bridge at the moment."
    "Well, recently we haven’t gone to my house, so I guess I don’t need an excuse not to go there."
    "I'd rather not tell Akari about my situation anyways."
    "She’ll probably try to \"fix\" it and do something stupid, or worse."
    "She could make me do something stupid."
    "I had better keep that a secret from the both of them."
    "I suppose I could still walk the two of them to the corner where we usually split off when we don’t have time to hang out, then turn around and come back to meet up with Suzuki."
    "With Akari stuck on \"Bathroom Duty\", I’m the only one available to walk her to the corner."
    "This is usually about the time she would meet us here."
    "I decide to wait for Miyu. I won’t be able to walk far with her, but I can at least tell her what’s up."

    "Miyu was always so serious about her pursuits, and her lectures always came from a place of passion. It always shone through when she got really into something."
    "It's hardly a surprise that she managed to get herself on the student council as Vice President. Most of the time she came off shy and reserved, but when she had something important to say, she could nail a rousing speech every time."
    Hiroya "I mean, you're not {i}wrong{/i}, but..."
    "I couldn't tip her off about my home situation yet. There were things I needed to sort out soon."
